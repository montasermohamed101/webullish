        'KWE provided some recent updates recently that indicate several important headlines in the coming day/s. I also see potential for a possible move up on the daily chart. The company also announced  that it will have a “prominent” participation at CANSEC 2023, May 31st and June 1st, in Ottawa, Canada. (CANSEC is Canada\'s signature annual defence show, and the company plans to show its latest Digitization and Counter-Threat systems and capabilities, plus its line of new Non-Lethal products.)Potential Targets: from current level @ \$2.90s I think it will see \$3.45> \$3.85> \$4.50+ with a stop loss below \$2.60. IMO Potential 15-45%KWE \$2.98NOTE: Stop loss, exit, and entry points mentioned in the alerts are all for informational purposes only, and must never be used as “buy” or “sell” signals. Each member MUST make their own financial decision based on their own research, and due diligence.',
